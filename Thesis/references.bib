	abstract = {We report the study of an “Einstein Cross” configuration first identified in a set of HST images by Cerny et al. Deep spectroscopic observations obtained at the Spanish 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias telescope, allowed us to demonstrate the lens nature of the system, that consists of a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG), not a quasi-stellar object as is usually the case, at z = 3.03 lensed by a galaxy at z = 0.556. Combining the new spectroscopy with the archival HST data, it turns out that the lens is an elliptical galaxy with MV = −21.0, effective radius 2.8 kpc, and stellar velocity dispersion σ = 208 ±39 km s−1. The source is an LBG with Lyα luminosity ∼L* at that redshift. From the modeling of the system, performed by assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) with external shear, we estimate that the flux source is magnified about 4.5 times, and the velocity dispersion of the lens is  km s−1, in good agreement with the value derived spectroscopically. This is the second case known of an Einstein cross of an LBG.}

abstract="We introduce a method to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of an estimator which is derived from a classification. The method chooses an optimal discrimination threshold in the outcome of a classification algorithm and deals with the problem of unequal and unknown misclassification costs and class imbalance. The approach is applied to data from the MAGIC experiment in astronomy for choosing an optimal threshold for signal-background-separation. In this application one is interested in estimating the number of signal events in a dataset with very unfavorable signal to background ratio. Minimizing the MSE of the estimation is a rather general approach which can be adapted to various other applications, in which one wants to derive an estimator from a classification. If the classification depends on other or additional parameters than the discrimination threshold, MSE minimization can be used to optimize these parameters as well. We illustrate this by optimizing the parameters of logistic regression, leading to relevant improvements of the current approach used in the MAGIC experiment.",

We develop spectral simulations based on the parameters for the 2-degree-field Galaxy Redshift Survey, and with these simulations we investigate the technique of principal component analysis when applied specifically to spectra of low S/N ratio. We relate the objective principal components to features in the spectra and use a small number of components to successfully reconstruct the underlying signal from the low-quality spectra. Using the principal components as input, we train an artificial neural network to classify the noisy simulated spectra into morphological classes, revealing the success of the classification against the observed bJ magnitude of the source, which we compare with alternative methods of classification. We find that more than 90 per cent of our sample of normal galaxies are correctly classified into one of the five broad morphological classes for simulations at bJ = 19.7. By dividing the data into separate sets, we show that a classification on to the Hubble sequence is relevant only for normal galaxies, and that spectra with unusual features should be incorporated into a classification scheme based predominantly on their spectral signatures. We discuss how an artificial neural network can be used to distinguish normal and unusual galaxy spectra, and also discuss the possible application of these results to spectra from galaxy redshift surveys.}",
